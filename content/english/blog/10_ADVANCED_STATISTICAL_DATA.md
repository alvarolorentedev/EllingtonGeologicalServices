Our in-house proprietary service “Advanced Statistical Data Analysis and Integration” can be used to build integrated data plots from all sorts of data, including well logs, XRD, XRF, FIS, Spectral Gamma on cuttings, ICP-AES+MS, etc.
Our in-house proprietary program incorporates the algorithm of incremental  sum-of-squares.  Clusters are defined so that the total within-cluster dispersion is the minimum possible.
