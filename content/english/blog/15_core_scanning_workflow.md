Traditional core analysis workflows do not capture or quantify heterogeneity at the core scale and may not identify important beds, features, or rock types.  These workflows often rely on statistical sampling that may not be representative of the reservoir as they rely on point measurements.

Ellington Geological Services provides unique core scanning capabilities that deliver continuous petrophysical, geological, mechanical, and other properties.

These continuous datasets enhance the value of core by supporting more strategic subsample selection across different rock types and improving log correlation to core data.
