The spectral gamma well logging using drill cuttings (wet/unwashed or dry/archived) is a new technology initially developed by Shell.  Our laboratory is the only one providing this service in Houston.
It provides quantitative measurements of potassium (K) in wt%, uranium (U) in ppm, and thorium (Th) in ppm, which are used to construct a spectral gamma-ray log in API units.  It is highly accurate, non-destructive, fast, and affordable.
