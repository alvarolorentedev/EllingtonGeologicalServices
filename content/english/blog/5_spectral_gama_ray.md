description : "Ellington’s highlight product: create spectral gamma ray log using drill cuttings"
---

The spectral gamma ray well logging using drill cuttings provides quantitative measurements of potassium (K) in wt%, uranium (U) in ppm, and thorium (Th) in ppm, which are used to construct a spectral gamma ray log in API units.  It is an advanced analytical technology, highly accurate, non-destructive, fast, and affordable.

### Key Technical Features

* Sample Material: wet or dry drill cuttings
* Sample Size: wet/unwashed cuttings (~150 g – 400 g); dry/archived cuttings (~100 g – 250 g)
* Sample Preparation: none (measurements are bulk sensitive)
* Data Acquisition: high quality data in ~3 minutes per sample
* Data Processing: proprietary spectral processing software
* Unique Instrumental Designs:
* Sodium Iodide (NaI) scintillation detector
* Auto sample loader
* Barcode reader for sample ID
* Weight sensor for sample weight
* Energy range (0.05 MeV – 3 MeV)
* Number of Energy Channels (1024)


### Applications

* Determine confidence level between results from drill cuttings and LWD or wireline logs
* Provide alternative gamma log when LWD or wireline GR log is absent or uncertain
* Estimate shale/clay contents
* Identify clay depositional environments
* Archive and store wet/unwashed drill cuttings
