Ellington’s sample management service has been in operation for over 30 years. We can take care of your well samples (cuttings and cores) throughout the entire workflow. Once samples leave the wellsite and arrive at our location we will perform all services tailored according to your requirements.

Ellington’s lab specializes in high volume, rapid turnaround sample processing.

Our sample management system provides a reliable and efficient organization and inventory for samples. Services include sample splitting, compositing, disposal, cleaning cuttings, and preparing for archiving, e.g., drying and systematically bagging and labeling samples with interval, well, client, and operator information.

We offer short-term and long-term storage and organize receiving samples from the wellsite and facilitating its shipment to the final destination.

We have a modern in-house wash laboratory for cleaning cutting samples for short-, and long-term preservation.
