Would you share your legendary rig experiences during bad weather? We'd love to hear from you! Tropical Storm Sally continues to intensify as it tracks towards the gulf coast and likely will make landfall as a hurricane on Tuesday. Our hearts go out to the Ellington Wellsite Paleo crews and all the other rig personnel currently on offshore rigs.
